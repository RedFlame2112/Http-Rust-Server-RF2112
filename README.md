# Http-Rust-Server-RF2112

This project was written by me in the Rust language. Works mostly as expected for now...


## Required Packages:

This program runs on Rust and Cargo package manager.

You can install both programs by running this command line within the CLI 
```$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh``` 

Afterwards, you can download the ZIP for this and head to the directory of the file. Once there, run:
```$ cargo run
   $ cargo build
```
The server then proceeds to listen in on localhost at port 8080. So head to the ip address `127.0.0.1:8080` to view the public index.html deployed to your local host. You can edit the html as you see fit; this is just a template.
